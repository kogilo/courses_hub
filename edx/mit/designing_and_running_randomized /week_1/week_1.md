# Evidence based policy making I
## So how are policies made?
* In their book, Poor Economics, Esther Duflo and Abhijit
Banerjee say that a lot of policies,
especially in developing countries, but also here,
a lot of them fail for a reason that they call the `three I's`.
  * `Ideology, ignorance, and inertia`.


* The idea is pretty self-explanatory.
  - Some people make policies just because `they believe it`
and it fits with their `identity` of kind of where they
are on some `political spectrum`.
- Some people don't want to bother changing ineffective policies
just because `it requires work`.
- And, I think, what we'd like to say is,
`ignorance` is a strong word.
But the fact of the matter is that `there's not
a lot of good`, hard evidence of which policies are working.
And so, it's hard to kind of promote or take down-- promote
an effective policy or take down an ineffective policy
if we don't know which of those are actually effective.

* So putting your head-- yourself in the head of a policymaker,
and many of you are policy makers,
so we like to kind of separate the world
into the world of policy making.
So Poor Economics talks a little bit about why policies fail.
And then, goes through a lot of evidence of which policies
seem to be showing promise.
And give some good frameworks for thinking about that.
But in terms of when you are making
a new policy, what is the thought
process that you go through?
Is it you basically have an opinion of what works--
of the way the world works?
Is it very subjective?
Or is it more objective?
Is there kind of an evidence-based model.
Do you have either scientific, rigorous, quantitative
evidence?
Do you have non-rigorous quantitative evidence?
Is it more qualitative evidence from research?
Or is it more just kind of based on the experience, intuition,
impressions?
Or is it `expediency`, whatever is kind of politically convenient?

* these
are kind of like the various reasons
why policies are made-- I'd like to ask you,
how do you think policies are made?
* Now I don't necessarily mean this as, kind of a-- this
is more of an opinion question.
And this may be based on your experience and your position,
previous positions.
