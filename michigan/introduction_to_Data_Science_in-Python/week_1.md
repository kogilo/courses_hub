# Python Functions
  * Python is a `high level language`, which means it's `optimized for reading by people instead of machines`.
  It's also an `interpreted language` which means it isn't `compiled directly` to machine code and importantly is commonly used in an interactive fashion.
  * Example
  ```python
  x = 1
  y=2
  x+y
  x
  ```
  * doesn't require key word like  `var` to declare the variable.
```python
  def add_numbers(x,y,z):
      return x+y+z
  print(add_numbers(1,2,3))
```
